## Hi there, I'm Oluwadamilola 'Dami' Kadiri!👋 
### Welcome to my Github! :smiley:

### About Me
I have always been fascinated about what made the machines around us work, now I'm studying how to make machines learn. I'm an MSc student at Western University, London, Ontario, Canada studying Computer Engineering with a specialization in Robotics. My area of research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence and robotics to space exploration technologies specifically rover systems. I also have a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from Western University. My studies and interests have given me a solid foundation in Machine/Deep Learning, Software Development and Computer Systems Design. 

### Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
* [Estimating NBA Player Impact with Deep Learning](https://github.com/dkadiry/NBA_Player_Impact): Designed a Multi-Layer Perceptron model that can accurately predict team wins given the teams season stats. This model achieved an R2 score of 0.92 beating out the established Pythagorean Win Model (0.91). By plugging the team stats for an imaginary team comprising of 14 average players (created using NBA player stats), and 1 NBA player to be evaluated, we can see how many extra wins our NBA player contributes to a team. 

* [Hotel Booking Predictor](https://github.com/dkadiry/BresciaNortonClassifier): Developed a Machine learning model that can predict if a client will cancel or keep their hotel booking for a Hackathon. Won 3rd place for the model design and presentation.

* [Movie Sentiment Classifier](https://github.com/dkadiry/Sentiment_Analysis_Project): Designed a deep learning hybrid model for classifying movie review sentiments. The model uses a pretrained Word2Vec for embedding the words in the review, an LSTM for extracting a new feature representation for the review, and an Ensemble of an SVC, XGBoost and KNN classifiers to perform the final classificiation. The design achieved an accuracy of 86.4%.


### Skills
* Proficient in Python, C++, Java, Matlab 
* Experience using NumpY, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn
* Experience in Machine Learning, Project Management, and Software Design
* Experience in Arduino Programming, Circuit Design, and Robotics
