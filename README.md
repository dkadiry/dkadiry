## Hi there, I'm Oluwadamilola 'Dami' Kadiri!ðŸ‘‹ 
### Welcome to my Github! :smiley:

### About Me
I have always been fascinated about what made the machines around us work, now everyday I work on teaching machines to see. I just concluded my MSc at Western University, London, Ontario, Canada where I conducted research in Robotics/Control with a collaborative specialization in planetary science and exploration. My area of research focuses on the application of artificial intelligence and robotics to space exploration technologies specifically rover systems. I also have a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from Western University. My studies and interests have given me a solid foundation in Computer Vision, Robotic Perception Systems, Machine/Deep Learning, Software Development, and Computer Systems Design. 

### Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
* [Depth Estimation Model with Pose Integration](https://github.com/dkadiry/pose-aware-monocular-depth-estimator): A U-Net-based model incorporating pose data to investigate the influence of pose data on monocular depth estimation for resource-constrained rovers. This project is part of my MSc thesis at Western University titled **"Investigating the Influence of Scale Cues and Pose Integration on AI-Based Monocular Depth Estimation for Resource-Constrained Mobile Robots."**

* [Monocular Pose Estimation Algorithm](https://github.com/dkadiry/final-pose-estimator): A robust algorithm using SIFT, RANSAC, Particle Filters, and YOLO to estimate a roverâ€™s pose from monocular camera images, scaled using environmental cues. This project is part of my MSc thesis at Western University titled **"Investigating the Influence of Scale Cues and Pose Integration on AI-Based Monocular Depth Estimation for Resource-Constrained Mobile Robots."**

* [Deep Learning Based NBA Salary Recommender System](https://github.com/dkadiry/NBA_Player_Impact): Designed a Multi-Layer Perceptron model that can accurately predict team wins given the teams season stats. This model achieved an R2 score of 0.92 beating out the established Pythagorean Win Model (0.91). By plugging the team stats for an imaginary team comprising of 14 average players (created using NBA player stats), and 1 NBA player to be evaluated, we can see how many extra wins our NBA player contributes to a team. 

* [Award Winning Hackathon Project Hotel Booking Predictor](https://github.com/dkadiry/BresciaNortonClassifier): Developed a Machine learning model that can predict if a client will cancel or keep their hotel booking for a Hackathon. Won 3rd place for the model design and presentation.

* [Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project](https://github.com/dkadiry/Sentiment_Analysis_Project): Designed a deep learning hybrid model for classifying movie review sentiments. The model uses a pretrained Word2Vec for embedding the words in the review, an LSTM for extracting a new feature representation for the review, and an Ensemble of an SVC, XGBoost and KNN classifiers to perform the final classificiation. The design achieved an accuracy of 86.4%.



### Coming Soon
These projects, currently in private and local repositories, will be made public upon the completion of my masterâ€™s degree:

* 

* Multi-Threaded Rover Control System: Python-based control software for managing a ClearPath Husky Rover and synchronized stereo cameras on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2.
  
Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€


### Skills
* Proficient in Python, C++, Java, Matlab 
* Experience using NumpY, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn
* Experience in Machine Learning, Computer Visison, Project Management, and Software Design
* Experience in Arduino Programming, Circuit Design, and Robotics
